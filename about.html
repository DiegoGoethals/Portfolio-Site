    <h2>A little bit about myself</h2>
    <p>My name is Diego Goethals, I'm a 21 year old student in Computer Science at Howest Brugge in Belgium.
    I started this study because I am very interested in computers and programming and everything that comes with it.
    I have been studying computer science for 3 years now so I would say I have some experience now.
    The languages I can honestly say I am skilled at are: Python, Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript, but I am always open
    to learn new things. To see what projects I made in the past, click the Projects button in the top bar to get a
    link to my github and links to some of my projects to experience them by yourself. If you wish to contact me press the
