    <h2>A little bit about myself</h2>
    <p>My name is Diego Goethals, I'm a 21 year old student in Computer Science at Howest Brugge in Belgium.
    I started this study because I am very interested in computers and programming and everything that comes with it.
    I have been studying computer science for 3 years now so I would say I have some experience now.
    The languages I can honestly say I am skilled at are: Python, Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript, but I am always open
    to learn new things. To see what projects I made in the past, click the Projects button in the top bar to get a
    link to my github and links to some of my projects to experience them by yourself. If you wish to contact me press the
    Contact button to get my contact credentials</p>
