    <h1>To do app</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            This is a simple to do app that I made to practice my React and Firebase skills. It's a simple app that allows
            you to add tasks, mark them as done and delete them. It also has a login system that allows you to create an
            account and login with it. The app is hosted on Firebase. I used Firebase's Firestore to store the tasks and
            Firebase's Authentication to handle the login system. Since it's a React app you can also use it as a PWA, this
            means that you can install it on your phone and use it as a mobile app, so you can always easily use the app wherever
            you are and don't always need to have your laptop with you to use the app. I made this app because sometimes I
            get ideas for things to do but don't have anything with me to write it down, with this app I always have my to do
            lists with me and can easily add new tasks to it. The app will still receive updates in the future, I'm planning
            on adding an extra overview of just ideas and not only to dos, so you can also use the app to write down ideas
            for projects or other things.
