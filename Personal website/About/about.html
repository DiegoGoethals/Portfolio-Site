    <h2>A little bit about myself</h2>
    <p>My name is Diego Goethals, I'm a 20 years old student in Computer Science at the University of Ghent in Belgium.
        I made this website to show and improve some of my skills and display them in this website and the projects you
        can find in the link to my github. The projects you can find are things I had to make for school
        or just some things that I like to work on in my spare time. For now I mainly like to use Python, JavaScript, Java and a bit of C#,
        I'm also pretty skilled in using JavaFX and PostgreSQL and obviously HTML and CSS, however I'm most definitely open to learning new things,
        learning and improving my skills is the main reason I created this website as I said before. I also made this website so people could ask me
        to help them with their projects. I would like to help on real life projects as I don't have any experience with real programming projects
        as I only have made the projects for school and some little tiny things I do at home. If you wish to contact me and would like to give me a
        chance to get some experience please click on the contact link above.</p>
