<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
<div>
    <h2>A little bit about myself</h2>
    <p>My name is Diego Goethals, I'm a 20 years old student in computer science at the University of Ghent in Belgium.
        I made this website to show and improve some of my skills and display them in this website and the projects you
        can find in the link to my github. The projects you can find are things I had to make for school
        or just some things that I like to work on in my spare time. For now I mainly like to use Python, JavaScript, Java and a bit of C#, however
        I'm most definitely open to learn new things and maybe even new programming languages, learning and improving my skills is the main reason
        I created this website as said before.</p>
    <h2>My Skills</h2>
    <p>As I said in the paragraph above I currently know how to use Python, JavaScript, Java and C#. I would say I'm pretty good at Python and
        JavaScript, Java I'm just decently good at and C# I'm really new at. I'm a really fast learner and like to learn new things.</p>
