        <p>
            This is the first real 'project' I made and wanted to share with you. I made this game because I wanted to
            improve and enhance my front-end skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The idea for this game actually started
            when a friend of mine made his own guessing game about Star Wars, you can find this game here on:
            <a href="https://swrdle.be/" target="_blank">swrdle.be</a>. After I saw his really well-made game I immediately
            got the idea to make a similar game about Pokémon. I have always been a fan of Pokémon and I remembered they
            once had the game during the show to guess which pokémon was displayed.
